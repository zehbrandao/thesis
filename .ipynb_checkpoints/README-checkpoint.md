# thesis
 All code used on my PhD thesis, along with data and some of the outputs.
 
Despite my best efforts, there might be some instances in which the code might improve in readability, generalization, and computational efficiency. Nonetheless, I'll leave as it is for the time being, especially because the code is not and end in itself, but is the means to develop the Thesis and to attend to (sometimes urgent) deadlines.
 
 This is a work in progress and all code is being submitted as it goes.
 
 # Repo Structure
**A — Wrangling Space** of all base maps and geodata that are necessary either (a) as input to the model or (b) as aids for analysis.
 
**B — OD and GTFS** data analysis

**C — Preliminary spatial analysis:** empirical patterns and trends derived from base land use maps
